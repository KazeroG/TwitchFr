			<h2> What are we all about really? </h2>
			<p>We are the Sticky Twitchers. Alas we are not sticky and twitching after spilling our fourth can of monster on our lap while believing we can see the future. Though that's  probably not as far from the truth as it should be.... </p>
			
			<p>Watching the rise of games being streamed online with the gamers becoming celebrities themselves an opening became apparent, mixing the real with the virtual even further. Our goal is to broadcast streams with guest stars relevant in some way to the chosen game, for instance what would an actual surgeon have to say playing surgeon simulator..streamed live..with one of us hosting as devil's advocate? Or perhaps professional cleaners playing viscera cleanup detail as a group?</p> 

			<p>Games are born in the mind and constructed in reality and then forged in the virtual . If we can tap into the gaming generation coming of age now with life experience and higher education and unite them with games and simulators relevant to their chosen fields the possibilities are intriguing.</p>
			<p>We are named the Sticky Twitchers in truth because we're based for now out of our twitch channel and because we hope to make streams so freaky mad and intelligent that we'll stick in your mind..until our next show ;-)
			</p>
			<p> Currently we have access to a few candidates our first has a masters in philosophy so just trying to match up a game to that. Also an Immunology student which after plague inc released a multiplayer update we might get two and start plague wars!! Prehaps you would rather see scince vs philosophy trials though? please do let us know or apply to be a guest star yourself!!</p>
